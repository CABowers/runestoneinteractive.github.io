          <h2>Our Structure</h2>
          <p>There are a number of different ways to get involved with Runestone Interactive development. For example:</p>
          <ul>
            <li>Developing and changing the <a href="" alt="Link to Runestone Components repository">Runestone Components</a>, which are additions to <a href="">reStructured Text</a> that allow authors to add code exercises in a Runestone Interactive online textbook.</li><br><br>
            <li>Developing and working on the <a href="" alt="Link to Runestone Server repository">Runestone Server</a>, which allows us to serve interactive textbooks in a useful, secure way. There are also many possible integrations with the Runestone software. Join <a href="">the discussions</a>!</li><br><br>
            <li>Developing the existing test suite, for both the Runestone Components and the Runestone Server.</li><br><br>
            <li>Writing additional documentation, and/or editing existing documentation for clarity.</li><br><br>
            <li>Developing and editing more open source textbooks! Check out the <a href="library.html">library</a> of books we host and the information for <a href="instructors.html">instructors</a> for more information.

          </ul>

          <p>TBD a nice diagram explaining how things work together???</p>

          <h2>It'll be helpful to learn...</h2>


           <ul>
            <li><strong>Python</strong>! A lot of the development of Runestone Interactive is in the Python language. It is currently in Python 2, but all code written should be 2/3 compatible. (The <code>six</code> library, which helps with this, is a dependency of all Runestone-related repositories.)</li>
            <li><strong><a href="https://virtualenv.pypa.io/en/stable/">Virtual environments</a> for development in Python</strong>, which will help tremendously with development, especially if you work on several different aspects of the Runestone project (or other large Python projects like this)</li>
            <li><strong>JavaScript</strong>! The RunestoneComponents are powered in large part by JavaScript (but there's also Python, HTML, etc).</li>
            <li><strong>Git and GitHub</strong>, which we use for version control and development. GitHub has <a href="">some great tutorials</a> to help getting used to using Git and making pull requests in order to make contributions.</li>
           </ul>

           <p>The Runestone Components are additional reStructure Text directives that allow authors to create things like this, which the Runestone Server allows us to power:

      <dt>Set up a virtualenv for Runestone work</dt>
      <dd>There are a number of dependencies, and this will make it easy to complete the installations for Runestone development.</dd>

      <dt>Install the development version of Runestone Components</dt>
        <dd>The <a href="">RunestoneComponents</a> GitHub repository's readme has a bunch of information about how to do this. This is the first part you should install. You can stop here and look at that README if you don't want to do any development on the server.<br><br>Runestone Components itself is in PyPi as <code>runestone</code>, so you can install it with pip, but if you're working on code development of anything for Runestone Interactive, you'll likely want to be able to interact with the code and see the development versions. Activate your virtual environment, and fork and clone this repository.</dd>

      <dt>Install Runestone Components and its requirements</dt>
          <dd>With your virtual environment activated, access the root of your Runestone Components directory, and run <code>pip install -e {path to your clone of RunestoneComponents}</code><br><br>Then, with your virtualenv still activated, navigate to the root of your RunestoneComponents directory and run <code>pip install -r requirements.txt</code> to install all Runestone Components dependencies.</dd>

      <dt>Install the web2py application for the Runestone Server</dt>
          <dd>The Runestone Server is a <a href="http://www.web2py.com">web2py</a> application, so you first need to download web2py. You should download the .zip file of source code from <a href="http://www.web2py.com/init/default/download">here</a> (if you get web2py from apt-get or GitHub, you may miss some of the necessary submodules).<br><br>Next, fork and clone the <a href="https://github.com/RunestoneInteractive/RunestoneServer">Runestone Server</a> repository.</dd>

      <dt>Deploy</dt>
          <dd>You can serve your project right from your own computer by running <code>runestone serve</code>  Or you can copy the folder in the build subdirectory created by the build command anywhere that will serve a static website, including a site that supports github pages.</dd>
